# Stripe Content Generation - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-10
**Status:** Backend Templates Ready, Frontend Pending

---

## ✅ Decisions Made

### Payment Flow
- **Approach:** Pay Before Generation (not after)
- **Refund Policy:** Automatic 100% refund if generation fails
- **Payment Method:** Stripe Payment Intents (variable pricing)

### Data Security
- **Card Storage:** NO - Stripe handles all card data (PCI compliant)
- **Customer ID:** YES - Store `stripe_customer_id` in Firestore (not sensitive)
- **Payment Methods:** NO - Don't save cards, let Stripe handle per-transaction

### Receipts & Invoices
- **Handled By:** Stripe (automatic)
- **Sent To:** User's email automatically
- **Our Action:** None required (Stripe does it all)

## 📁 Files Created

### Documentation
1. **`STRIPE_CONTENT_GENERATION_PLAN.md`** - Complete implementation plan
2. **`IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`** - Detailed implementation steps & reasoning
3. **`backend_templates/BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`** - Backend setup instructions
4. **`STRIPE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

### Backend Code (Templates)
1. **`backend_templates/content_payment.py`** - All 3 payment endpoints:
   - `POST /api/content/create-payment-intent` - Creates Stripe Payment Intent
   - `POST /api/content/verify-and-create-job` - Verifies payment, creates job
   - `POST /api/content/refund-failed-job` - Auto-refunds failed generations

---

## 🎯 What Each Endpoint Does

### 1. Create Payment Intent
**Called:** When user clicks "Pay & Generate - $14.90"

**Does:**
1. Calculates exact amount ($1.49 or $2.49 per page)
2. Gets/creates Stripe customer
3. Creates Payment Intent
4. Returns `client_secret` for frontend payment form

**Result:** Frontend can show Stripe payment form

---

### 2. Verify and Create Job
**Called:** After user completes payment in Stripe form

**Does:**
1. Verifies payment succeeded with Stripe (source of truth)
2. Verifies user owns this payment (security)
3. Checks for duplicate jobs (idempotent)
4. Creates job in Firestore with payment tracking
5. Triggers content generation

**Result:** Content generation begins (user already paid)

---

### 3. Refund Failed Job
**Called:** By generation worker when generation fails

**Does:**
1. Gets job from Firestore
2. Checks if already refunded (idempotent)
3. Creates refund in Stripe
4. Updates job status to 'failed_refunded'
5. Stripe emails receipt to customer

**Result:** User gets full refund automatically

---

## 🔧 Backend Integration Steps

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install Stripe
pip install stripe>=5.0.0

# 2. Add environment variable
echo "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY" >> backend/.env

# 3. Copy endpoint file
cp frontend/backend_templates/content_payment.py backend/app/api/

# 4. Register router in main.py
# from app.api import content_payment
# app.include_router(content_payment.router)

# 5. Update generation worker to call refund on failure
# See BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md for details

# 6. Test endpoints
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/content/create-payment-intent ...
```

**Full Instructions:** See `backend_templates/BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`

## 🔒 Security Notes

### What's Secure
✅ All card data handled by Stripe (PCI compliant)
✅ We never see or store card numbers
✅ Payment verification on backend (can't be faked)
✅ Frontend gets one-time `client_secret` (expires)
✅ Customer ID is not sensitive data

### What to Avoid
❌ Never store card numbers
❌ Never trust frontend for payment status
❌ Never skip payment verification
❌ Never expose Stripe secret key

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Stripe Fees
- **Per Transaction:** 2.9% + $0.30
- **Example:** $14.90 charge = $0.73 fee = $14.17 net
- **Refunds:** Stripe returns the fee (no cost to us)

### Our Pricing
- **Standard:** $1.49/page (GPT-4o)
- **Pro:** $2.49/page (GPT-4 Turbo)

## 📈 Success Metrics

After implementation, track:
- Payment success rate (target: >95%)
- Refund rate (target: <5%)
- Average payment time (target: <60 seconds)
- Customer satisfaction with payment UX

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why Payment Intents instead of Products?**
A: Variable pricing ($14.90, $24.90, any amount). Products would need hundreds of SKUs.

**Q: Why pay before instead of after?**
A: Simpler, no unpaid content, can refund if fails. Standard e-commerce pattern.

**Q: Do we store payment methods?**
A: No. Stripe can do this via their customer portal, but we don't manage it.

**Q: What if refund fails?**
A: Extremely rare. Stripe handles disputes. We can manually refund in dashboard.

**Q: How long do refunds take?**
A: Instant in Stripe, 5-10 business days to customer's card (bank timing).

**Q: Can customers dispute?**
A: Yes, via their bank. Stripe notifies us, we respond in dashboard.
