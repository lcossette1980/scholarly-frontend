📚 Researchers: Stop spending 4 hours on annotated bibliographies.

I've been working with academic researchers for the past year, and the #1 time sink I hear about is literature review work—specifically creating annotated bibliographies.

Reading 50+ page papers. Extracting key findings. Formatting citations. Finding relevant quotes. Writing coherent summaries.

It's essential work, but it's also incredibly time-consuming.

That's why we built ScholarlyAI.

What it does:
→ Analyzes research papers in 90 seconds
→ Generates complete annotated bibliography entries
→ Extracts citations, summaries, findings, methodology, and quotes
→ Supports APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard formats
→ Uses YOUR sources to generate research topics & outlines

The result: What took 4 hours now takes 2 minutes.

10,000+ researchers have saved an average of 18 hours per month using ScholarlyAI.

If you're working on a dissertation, thesis, or any research project with extensive lit reviews, this tool will change how you work.

#### LinkedIn Post 2: Problem/Solution Story
```
The most painful part of my PhD wasn't the research.

It was the 47 hours I spent each semester on annotated bibliographies.

Same process, repeated 30+ times:

1. Read the entire paper (90 min)
2. Highlight key passages (45 min)
3. Extract methodology details (30 min)
4. Find quotable moments (30 min)
5. Write a coherent summary (45 min)
6. Format the citation correctly (15 min)
7. Proofread everything (15 min)

Total: 4+ hours per paper.

And heaven forbid you realize you missed the methodology section and have to start over.

After my qualifying exams, I started wondering: "Why can't AI do this?"

So we built ScholarlyAI.

It does everything I listed above—in 90 seconds.

But here's what makes it different from other bibliography tools:

After you build your bibliography, ScholarlyAI analyzes ALL your sources together and:
→ Identifies research gaps
→ Suggests original research topics
→ Generates complete paper outlines

All based on YOUR bibliography sources. Not random suggestions—actual, evidence-based topics from the papers you've already analyzed.

We launched 6 months ago. 10,000+ researchers are using it. Average time saved: 18 hours/month.

#### LinkedIn Post 3: Feature Highlight (Topic Generator)
```
🎯 Feature Spotlight: The Topic & Outline Generator

One of the biggest challenges in academic research isn't finding sources—it's knowing what to DO with them.

You've read 15 papers. You've highlighted passages. You've taken notes.

Now what? What's your research question? What gaps exist? How do you structure your literature review?

This is where most researchers spend DAYS of deep thinking and synthesis.

ScholarlyAI's new Topic & Outline Generator solves this:

How it works:
1. Build your annotated bibliography (5-15 sources)
2. Click "Generate Topics"
3. Get 3-5 research topic suggestions + complete paper outlines

What makes it unique:
→ Based on YOUR actual sources (not generic AI suggestions)
→ Identifies real gaps in the literature
→ Generates outlines with specific source references
→ Shows which papers support each section

Example:
After analyzing 10 papers on machine learning in healthcare, it suggested:
"The Impact of ML on Early Disease Detection: A Systematic Review"

Gap identified: "Limited research on real-world clinical integration"

Outline sections:
→ Introduction (refs: Smith 2024, Lee 2024)
→ Current ML Diagnostic Tools (refs: Johnson 2023, Chen 2024)
→ Clinical Integration Challenges (refs: Rodriguez 2023)
→ Future Directions (synthesis of all sources)

This is something NO other bibliography tool does.

Available on our Researcher plan ($19.99/mo).

**Title:** "PSA: Stop manually creating annotated bibliographies (I found a better way)"

**Body:**
```
Not trying to spam, just genuinely want to help because this saved my life during qualifying exams.

I spent my entire first year of my PhD manually creating annotated bibliographies. Would sit down with a paper, read all 50+ pages, highlight passages, take notes, write a summary, format the citation...

Each paper took 4+ hours.

I had to do this for 30+ papers per semester.

Then I found ScholarlyAI (scholarlyaiapp.com).

Upload PDF → Get complete annotated bibliography entry in 90 seconds.

Not just a citation. Full summary, key findings, methodology analysis, quotes with page numbers. Everything formatted in APA/MLA/Chicago.

I know, I know - sounds too good to be true. I was skeptical too.

But I tried the free version (5 entries, no credit card) and holy shit. It actually works.

The best part: After you build your bibliography, it analyzes all your sources together and suggests research topics + generates paper outlines based on gaps in the literature. I've never seen another tool do this.

I'm now on the paid plan ($9.99/mo for unlimited). Saved me 40+ hours last semester.

Try it free: https://scholarlyaiapp.com

Not affiliated, just a happy user who wishes someone had told me about this during first year.

Edit: Yes, you should still read the papers. But this gives you a solid starting point and saves HOURS of formatting/summarizing work.

### **r/PhD Post**

**Title:** "[Tool] Topic & Outline Generator based on YOUR lit review sources"

**Body:**
```
Sharing a tool I've been using for my dissertation lit review.

ScholarlyAI has a feature where after you build your annotated bibliography, it analyzes all your sources together and:

1. Identifies gaps in the literature
2. Suggests 3-5 research topics
3. Generates complete paper outlines with specific source references

Example: I uploaded 12 papers on machine learning in healthcare.

It suggested: "The Impact of ML on Early Disease Detection: A Systematic Review"

Gap identified: "Limited research on real-world clinical integration challenges"

Then gave me a full outline:
- Introduction (refs: Smith 2024, Chen 2024)
- Current Diagnostic Tools (refs: Johnson 2023, Lee 2024)
- Integration Challenges (refs: Rodriguez 2023, Kumar 2024)
- Future Directions (synthesis of all sources)

Saved me DAYS of synthesis work.

It's $19.99/mo (Researcher plan). You can also just use it for the bibliography generation ($9.99/mo Student plan) which is honestly worth it alone.

Free trial: scholarlyaiapp.com

Has anyone else used this? Curious if others have found similar tools.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ScholarlyAI Launches AI-Powered Research Tool That Generates Annotated Bibliographies in 90 Seconds

New platform helps researchers save average of 18 hours per month on literature reviews

[CITY, STATE] - [DATE] - ScholarlyAI, an AI-powered research platform, today announced the launch of its automated annotated bibliography generator that reduces the time researchers spend on literature reviews from hours to minutes.

ScholarlyAI's AI analyzes research papers in 90 seconds and generates complete annotated bibliography entries with citations, summaries, key findings, methodology analysis, and relevant quotes.

"We built ScholarlyAI after spending countless hours manually creating annotated bibliographies during our PhD programs," said [Founder Name], CEO of ScholarlyAI. "The average researcher spends 47 hours per semester on this task alone. Our platform gives those hours back."
